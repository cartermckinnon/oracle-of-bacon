# Oracle of Bacon

This is a Java application that uses an MPAA database of film credits to link any Hollywood actor to Kevin Bacon through mutual starring roles. The output includes the names of actors building the relationship, along with the relevant films. 

## Installation & Usage

After compilation, the main method ( in class BaconNumber ) can be executed by command line. Modifications to use command line arguments are in the works; for now the actors to be searched for are explicitly defined in main().
